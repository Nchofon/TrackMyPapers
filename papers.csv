LSM-2: Learning from Incomplete Wearable Sensor Data,arXiv:2506.05321v1,"This paper introduces the second generation of Large Sensor Model (LSM-2) with Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM), a novel SSL approach that learns robust representations directly from incomplete data without requiring explicit imputation. AIM’s core novelty lies in its use of learnable mask tokens to model both existing (""inherited"") and artificially introduced missingness, enabling it to robustly handle fragmented real-world data during inference. Pre-trained on an extensive dataset of 40M hours of day-long multimodal sensor data, our LSM-2 with AIM achieves the best performance across a diverse range of tasks, including classification, regression and generative modeling","Self Supervised Learning (SSL), Adaptive and Inherited Masking (AIM)",,2025-07-22
Explainable Parallel CNN-LSTM Model for Differentiating Ventricular Tachycardia from Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy in 12-Lead ECGs,https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14196,"A computationally efficient deep learning solution to improve diagnostic accuracy, differentiating wide complex tachycardia, and provide model interpretability for clinical deployment. Explainability is achieved via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Model is a CNN + LSTM","wide complex tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy, XAI",,2025-07-22
Mixture-of-Recursions: Learning Dynamic Recursive Depths for Adaptive Token-Level Computation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10524,"This paper introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework that combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer. MoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter efficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by dynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens.",MoR,,2025-07-22
